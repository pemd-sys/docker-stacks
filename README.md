# Docker

A selection of dockerfiles. Images will be made available available on docker hub.
Contrarily to other images, those images aim to be up-to-date and are mostly available also for different architectures such as AMD64, ARM64, ARMV7, and ARMV6.


## Getting Started

The project relies on docker.
For each dockerfile/docker image, an according subfolder exists including a README that explains how to use the docker image.


### Prerequisites

You need docker installed on your machine to build the dockerfiles and run the images.
Follow the [installation](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/) as described by docker.


### Creating Images

Clone the repository, open into the according directory and create the image, e.g.:
```
cd mpich
docker build . -t mpich:latest
```

If you wish to create a docker image for a different architecture, follow the steps described in the [docker documentations](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/multi-arch/) that use buildx.


## Artifacts

The docker images will be made available on docker hub.
